This is my glucose reminder SPA. Used a different generative AI for this version. 
For this version I used my old friend, Blackbox AI. I forgot just how much I enjoy this AI over CHatGPT. I gave Blackbox AI the same exact prompt (compy-pasted) and it delivered an SPA (almost) exactly how I imagined, which cannot be said about using Codex from ChatGPT. I did then convert the code from the format given by Blackbox to html using CHatGPT, as I had used the integrated web app functionality on Blackbox AI. 


  For this project, I chose to tackle a niche problem where I believed technology could be an asset. As a diabetic and as a member of a family with many diabetics, I know firsthand the struggles of managing the disease. Everyone who knows of diabetes knows that monitoring your blood glucose (often referred to as blood sugar) levels is vital to managing the disease. What some might not know is the exact times you need to check your blood sugar. The most well-known time to check your blood sugar is in the morning, before you have had any food or drink (water is fine); this is known as your fasting blood sugar level. The equally important, but not well-known, time to check is exactly two hours after eating a meal. Dinner is usually the meal chosen for this. This is vital to capturing how your body reacts to carbohydrates and sugars being introduced, and can even further help to manage diabetes by showing which foods spike an individual’s blood sugar level more. The issue some people (like me) run into is forgetting to set a timer for the two hours or even glancing at the time. This simple SPA aims to tackle this obstacle.

  
  When entering the site, users will be greeted with a big blue circular button in the center of the page: “NomNom time”. A simple press of this automatically starts a 2-hour countdown. At the end of the countdown, an alert sound will play, as well as confetti coming across the screen – ensuring your attention can be captured. The screen now displays: “I will check now” as well as having two hourglass images rotating on either side of the blue button every five seconds until you click the button that now reads: “I have checked”. This is very simple, yet very helpful for those who are living with diabetes. 

  
  The two hourglass images are not the best, and that is something that I would choose to improve in the future. It is not a bug or affects the SPA functionality in any way, but it gives the site a cheap, tacky feel. Another known ‘issue’ is with the testing of the functionality without having to wait the 2 hours. I did have Blackbox AI write a code to test it for 2 minutes, which showed proper functionality, but obviously, this did not make it into the deployment version. 

  
  As for future enhancements, I would like to use this SPA as a foundation for a more intuitive, more accessible, more in-depth application. A future integration into smartphones and smart watches will help make the app more usable as it is more easily reachable to use its functionality.
